# py-projects
The purpose of this repository is to track progress, and showcase selected mini projects in python. It is made for personal use.
I may later start to develop larger projects which will greatly benefit from your help, so stay tuned for information. 
I also created dev-log, which are just a brief notes on what I did/will do in a project.
